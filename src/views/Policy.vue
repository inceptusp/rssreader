    <br />
    <h3>4. General Information</h3>
    <br />
    <h5>A. How We Share Information</h5>
    <br />
    We may share and disclose your Personal Information with the following types
    of third parties for the purposes described in this privacy policy (for
    purposes of this section, <strong>"you"</strong> and
    <strong>"your"</strong> refer to User and Visitors unless otherwise
    indicated). <br /><br />
    <strong>(i)</strong> Any competent law enforcement body, regulatory body,
    government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is
    necessary (a) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (b) to exercise,
    establish, or defend our legal rights, or (c) to protect your vital
    interests or those of any other person.
    <br />
    <strong>(ii)</strong> Any other person with your consent. <br /><br />
    <h5>B. Our Security</h5>
    <br />
    We take appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational measures
    designed to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized
    access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the
    risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.
    If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information,
    you may contact us at contato@aplikoj.com.<br /><br />RSS Reader accounts
    require a email and password to log in. Members must keep their email and
    password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the
    information in a Users’ RSS Reader account is private, account passwords are
    hashed, which means we cannot see a Users’ password. We cannot resend
    forgotten passwords either. We will only provide Users with instructions on
    how to reset them. <br /><br />
    <h3>C. International Transfers</h3>
    <br />
    <strong>(i)</strong> We operate in Brazil <br /><br />
    Our servers and offices are located in Brazil, so your information may be
    transferred to, stored, or processed in Brazil. While the data protection,
    privacy, and other laws of Brazil might not be as comprehensive as those in
    your country, we take many steps to protect your privacy.
    <br /><br />
    <h5>D. Retention of Data</h5>
    <br />
    We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business
    or legal need to do so. Our retention periods will vary depending on the
    type of data involved, but, generally, we'll refer to these criteria in
    order to determine retention period:
    <br /><br />
    <li>Whether the data is necessary to provide the Service.</li>
    <li>
      Whether our Users have the ability to access and delete the data within
      their RSS Reader accounts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whether our Users would reasonably expect that we would retain the data
      until they remove it or until their accounts are closed or terminated.
    </li>
    <br />
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal
    Information, we will delete it or, if this is not possible (for example,
    because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then
    we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any
    further processing until deletion is possible.
    <br /><br />
    <h5>E. Changes to this Policy</h5>
    <br />
    We may change this privacy policy at any time and from time to time. All
    updates and amendments are effective immediately upon notice, which we may
    give by any means, including, but not limited to, by posting a revised
    version of this privacy policy or other notice on the RSS Reader website. We
    encourage you to review this privacy policy often to stay informed of
    changes that may affect you.
    <br /><br />
    <h5>F. Questions & Concerns</h5>
    <br />
    If you have any questions or comments, or if you have a concern about the
    way in which we have handled any privacy matter, please send an email to
    contato@aplikoj.com.
